## Using matplot lib

```yaml

`@part2`


`@script`
After calculating our LOF scores in the previous section, we can use use a scatterplot to look at both our data points as well as their scores. To do this, we will call matplotlib on our data points and use the scores we previously calculated to draw some circles around our data points. The larger the circle, the higher the outlier score. This allows us to see which points had the highest outlier scores.
