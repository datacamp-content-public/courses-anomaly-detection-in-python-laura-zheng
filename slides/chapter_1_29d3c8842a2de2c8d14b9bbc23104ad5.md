## Scatterplot with LOF Scores

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 032903f780
```

`@part1`
- Simple way to see predicted anomalies {{1}} 
- Data points on X and Y axis {{2}} 
- Circles represent the calculated LOF scores {{3}} 

`@part2`
![](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_lof_outlier_detection_001.png){{4}} 

`@script`
After calculating our LOF scores in the previous section, we can use use a scatterplot to look at both our data points as well as their scores. To do this, we will call matplotlib on our data points and use the scores we previously calculated to draw some circles around our data points. The larger the circle, the higher the outlier score. This allows us to see which points had the highest outlier scores.

## LOF Scores from Credit Card Fraud

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: f0650ef026
```

`@part1`
```
plt.scatter(X['V4'], X['Amount'], color='k', s=5., label='Data points')
```

```
radius = (X_scores.max() - X_scores) / (X_scores.max() - X_scores.min())
plt.scatter(X['V4'], X['Amount'], s=1000 * radius, edgecolors='b',
            facecolors='none', label='Outlier scores')
```

```
legend = plt.legend(loc='upper left')
legend.legendHandles[0]._sizes = [10]
legend.legendHandles[1]._sizes = [20]
plt.show()
```

`@script`
This code plots our features from the credit card d ata along with circles to represent the LOF scores in the blue circles. The larger the circle, the higher the LOF scores. Let's break down this code in the next few slides.

## Plotting the points

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 717d1b4f2c
```

`@part1`
Creating the scatter plot
```
plt.scatter(X['V4'], X['Amount'], color='k', s=5., label='Data points')
```
- X and Y axes as our predictor and transaction amount
- Label as 'Data points'

`@script`
The first block of code tells Python to plot our two features, V4 and Amount. The color and size settings are set for black and size 5. We will label this as our data points.

## Plotting the circles

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 94d011b5d3
```

`@part1`
```
radius = (X_scores.max() - X_scores) / (X_scores.max() - X_scores.min())

```
- Calculates the size of the circles

```
plt.scatter(X['V4'], X['Amount'], s=1000 * radius, edgecolors='b',
            facecolors='none', label='Outlier scores')
```
- Plot the circles
- Label these as our outlier scores

`@script`
The next block of code tells Python to calculate the radius of the circles by subtracting the LOF score from the maximum calculated LOF score. This is then divided by the range in order to normalize it.

We then plot these circles once again using plt scatter, this time setting the size parameter to be 1000 times the radius, this means that the size of the circles now changes with the LOF scores. The higher the radius, the bigger the circle that it plots. We will label these as our Outlier Scores

## Adding a legend

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 67e20914b6
```

`@part1`
```
legend = plt.legend(loc='upper left')
legend.legendHandles[0]._sizes = [10]
legend.legendHandles[1]._sizes = [20]
plt.show()
```

`@script`
This final chunk of codes add a legend to our plot in the upper left hand corner and modifies the size of the legend handles so that they fit nicely within the legend itself. After using all of these commands, you now have a very nice plot of your LOF scores.

Here's another look at our finished plot. You will get a chance to make your own plot in the practice exercise coming up.

## Practice Exercise

```yaml

```

`@script`
Now that you've learned how to plot LOF scores around your data points, you will create a plot of LOF scores for the credit card data you previously calculated scores for. Let's get started!
